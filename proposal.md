# Stablenode Cosmos Validator Proposal

## Who We Are
- Validator: Stablenode Inc.
- Website: [stablenode.io](https://stablenode.io)
- Founders: Chjango Unchained (Head of Communications at Tendermint/Cosmos), Richard Li (General Partner, AlphaBlock), Aleksandr Bezobchuk (Senior Software Engineer, Tendermint/Cosmos)

## What We Offer
- *100% uptime guarantee* - If we do not meet this guarantee, insurance will cover you. Every delegator gets insurance by default, unless for some reason you decide to opt out. Insurance payments are paid out of band, as this feature is not supported by the Cosmos protocol. 

## Your Benefits
- *Insurance* - We reserve a liquidity pool of up to 30% of delegated Atoms to the Stablenode validator as an insurance guarantee for our delegators in case our validator ever gets slashed.

## Infrastructure

### Uptime
- Sentry node setup
- Networking/server professional
- Bastion server for 24/7 remote monitoring
- N + 1 server redundancy

### Facility
- Co-location in an Equinix data center and a redundant data center on a separate power grid operated out of the US.

## Vision
2018 is the year that Proof-of-Stake based protocols enter the market in a big way. With the launch of the Cosmos Network, following the mainnet launch of EOS and betanet launches of Tezos and Cardano. Casper FFG is on its way and many more. The pendulum is clearly swinging in the direction of PoS. And Stablenode offers a service to lower the barrier to entry for average cryptocurrency users to actively participate in providing multi-network security.

Stablenode is a premiere validator service. We will validate myriad Proof-of-Stake-based protocols, starting with the highest fidelity, and thus most technically demanding one: running a Cosmos Validator. After Stablenode's Cosmos Validator has been running at over 99.9999% uptime consistently, we will begin to run other validators.
